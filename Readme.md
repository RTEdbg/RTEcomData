# Transfer recorded data to the host via a serial channel

**Note:** The development of **RTEcomData** has been stopped. The full functionality is included in the **RTEgetData** utility, which supports data transfer via COM port as well as via debug probe (GDB server) - see **[RTEgetData](https://github.com/RTEdbg/RTEgetData).**

<br>

**This utility enables the transfer of data from the embedded system to the host via asynchronous serial channel.** <br>
The utility is part of the **RTEdbg toolkit**. See the [**RTEdbg main repository**](https://github.com/RTEdbg/RTEdbg) for the complete toolkit description and links to documentation and other repositories.
